Spring is slowly opening up upon us here in Minnesota and I suddenly find myself busy to the point of nearly being overwhelmed. I say "nearly" because I'm getting to do an awful lot of what I want to do, so even though I have very little spare time, I'm happy.

I've started work with Scott Flaskerud from [The Dear Sweet Villains](http://www.myspace.com/thedearsweetvillains) on a new CD project. Scott asked me to engineer and produce the CD for him. I gladly accepted. I've been able to fill a few gaps here and there by playing on it too. A real pleasure, even if it leaves me bleary-eyed after late nights poring over the sesssions.

Several sessions are lining up for [Minneapoliscast](http://minneapoliscast.com) in May and June including [Luke's Angels](http://lukesangels.com), [Brian Just](http://www.brianjust.com/) and [Aviette](http://www.aviettemusic.com/).

Finally I'm evaluating a new client's website for SEO as well as helping them leverage some social media technology to keep present and potential clients up to date on their latest projects. An old client has contacted me about a new project and of course, I'm busy helping my current clients.

Did I mention I have a full time job and family?

I love this time of year. I'm generally operating on the verge of exhaustion, but I certainly get a lot accomplished. If I had to complain about my current status, the only thing I'd say is that I was hoping to work more on my own music. What can I say? I've got to pay the bills.
