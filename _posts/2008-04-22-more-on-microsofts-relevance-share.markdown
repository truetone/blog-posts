A few days ago I wrote [a little entry about Microsoft's relevance share](http://anthonygthomas.com/2008/04/17/further-evidence-of-microsofts-loss-of-relevance-share/). Admittedly, my piece was more about perception and taken from a broad perspective of Microsoft's culture.

[Peter Bright wrote a really nice piece that says the same thing in much greater depth](http://arstechnica.com/authors.ars/PeterB). Bright's piece is up-close and personal. Well worth a read if you want to learn bow we got to where we are in the OS wars.
