[I've previously commented that mobile technology is the next frontier in the technology sphere](http://anthonygthomas.com/2008/04/03/amazoncom-announces-textbuyit/). It seems that Mike Arrington at [TechCrunch agrees](http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/04/09/i-saw-the-future-of-social-networking-the-other-day/). Look for the next tech boom to be in mobile technology. It's going to connect us in ways we never dreamed possible.

In the mid nineties when what we know as the web was overtaking the [Gopher procotol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_%28protocol%29) and computers were entering homes and lifestyles everywhere, there was some talk about the dehumanizing effect of the personal computer. Baby Boomers were worried that the kids would spend too much time isolated in front of the computer screen. That notion seems so quaint now.
