> One of the most remarkable features of science is that it often leads its practitioners to change their minds and to say â€œI was wrong.â€ Perhaps we donâ€™t do it enough, as our own blinders and egos can get in the way, but it does happen, and it certainly happens a lot more in science than it does in religion or politics. Iâ€™ve done it. I used to be a global warming skeptic, but I reconsidered the evidence and announced in Scientific American that I was wrong. Please reconsider both the evidence for vaccinations, as well as the inconsistencies in your position, and think about doing one of the bravest and most honorable things any critical thinker can do, and that is to publicly state, â€œI changed my mind. I was wrong.â€
