I've uploaded a new version of the [Baseline theme for Wordpress development](http://baseline.truetoneenterprises.com/). The only change this time around is that I'm using `[wp_enqueue_script()](http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_enqueue_script)` to include Wordpress' existing copy of JQuery. ([Hat tip to Chris Coyier](http://digwp.com/2009/06/including-jquery-in-wordpress-the-right-way/).) This seems like a significant enough change to merit a small version bump.

I used the Baseline theme as a launching pad for this website. At least for me, it serves as a good starting point when you begin developing a brand new theme.

If you find this useful, you might be interested in checking outÂ [Jeff Starâ€™s functions.php template](http://digwp.com/2010/03/wordpress-functions-php-template-custom-functions/).
