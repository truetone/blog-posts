I thought maybe Comcast was "[getting it](http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/04/06/comcast-twitter-and-the-chicken-trust-me-i-have-a-point/)." They seemed to be on the cutting edge of responding to consumers' needs by monitoring Twitter and blogs for complaints--and then responding to them.

Unfortunately [the problems seem so pervasive](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/craig-aaron/comcast-worst-company-eve_b_97568.html) that a simple campaign of [Google Alerts and Twitter monitoring can't fix them](http://valleywag.com/381016/not-even-comcasts-twitter+stalker-can-placate-dave-winer). The question remains then, is Comcast committed to truly listening and meeting consumers' needs or are they just trying to cheaply control their image? I wish it were the former. I think it's the latter.
