Wordpress 1.x was the first CMS to get me to move away from my old home-brewed CMS I used to use for blogging. Yesterday I upgraded this blog to [Worpress 2.5](http://wordpress.org/download/). Even though you can't see it, the admin area has a whole new look and support for audio and video in posts. I'm going to upgrade [Minneapoliscast](http://minneapoliscast.com) next to see how well it works with a podcast. Then a handful of other sites including the site I maintain for work.

This is my first post with the new interface. It's taking a little getting used to, but once I figure out where everything is I think I'll like it. I can't say I can give Wordpress a fair review in comparison to other CMS's since I've never used [Movable Type](http://http//movabletype.com/), [Joomla](http://joomla.org/), [Drupal](http://drupal.org/) or any other of a cornucopia of blogging applications and content management systems.

Anyone else have experience with these others? How do they compare?
