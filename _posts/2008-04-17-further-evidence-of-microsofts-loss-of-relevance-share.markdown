Lots and LOTS  of people own computers that run Microsoft Windows. I won't even go into market share figures. I'll grant you that point. But what is Microsoft's vision? [Is this it](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPv8PPl7ANU)? I certainly hope not.

If a bad spoof of a baby-boomer rock star signifies Microsoft's outlook--even internally--they have no hope of maintaining a monopoly into the next generation. Microsoft is a big ship. I'm not sure they can turn it around and catch up before users have moved on to new technology. What's remarkable to me is that they didn't have the sense to cut the spoof off after the first chorus. They just kept on going. Bad, bad, bad.
