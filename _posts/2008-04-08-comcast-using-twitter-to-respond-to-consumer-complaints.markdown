I don't think it's any secret that [Comcast has an image problem](http://blogsearch.google.com/blogsearch?q=comcast&ie=UTF-8&oe=utf-8&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a&um=1&sa=N&tab=wb). I have to give them some credit for trolling Twitter (or more likely going a [Tweetscan](http://www.tweetscan.com/)), and responding directly to consumer complaints with e-mails and phone calls from the executive's offices.

Do you see the value now?
