[Radiohead does it again](http://radiohead.com/deadairspace/). By now you've probably heard that Radiohead is offering the raw tracks of their "Nude" single for remixing. A few years ago this sort of thing would not have been possible, but with advent of GarageBand and other free and low-cost digital audio suites, thousands of people can participate and engage with Radiohead's music in a new and exciting way. I haven't purchased the tracks yet, but I'm about one visit to the iTunes Music Store away from doing it.

Radiohead has been able to position themselves at the forefront of this new model of distribution. So far it's been very successful for them, but can other artists leverage this same concept as successfully? Probably not. Radiohead has a huge and extremely devoted fanbase already in place. It's arguable that _anything_ they do is going to be successful.

Still, I think the concept is still new enough that independent artists can use the same idea to connect with their fans. [I used to be in an indie band called Anchorhead](http://anchorhead.net/). In 2001 and 2003 we gave both our CDs away on our website for free _before_ either one was released. Our fans and friends were familiar with our songs before the CDs came out and would often sing a long in the crowd. They also bought other merchandise, such as t-shirts and posters. We didn't get rich, but we weren't setting out to do so. A more serious band could replay that scenario in cities around the country. There's still a lot of work to be done for independent recording artists to gain a following, but with the right combination of good music and new distribution models, there is a myriad of ways to establish ongoing communication, feedback and personal connections with fans. Radiohead brings that to popular culture. Indie bands can bring it to their friends.
