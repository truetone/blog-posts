I've been using mind mapping software recently to work out data models, with some success. The Mindmeister example below is a simple database of a few related tables.<!-- more -->

Most folks who have done much work with relational databases won't need a mind map for simple relationships like the example above where tables are simple has-many or belongs-to relationships. But, it can come in very handy for getting your head around has-and-belongs-to-many relationships where join tables are involved.
