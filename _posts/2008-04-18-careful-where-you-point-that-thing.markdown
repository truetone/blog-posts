In four recent instances I've written something or mentioned something in a podcast where someone directly related to the subject found the post/podcast. That seems to me to be a relatively recent phenomenon.

Instance one: In a recent [Minneapoliscast podcast](http://minneapoliscast.com/2008/03/07/roundtable-discussion-with-stook-kyle-matteson-steve-mcpherson-tony-thomas-musical-guest-ben-kyle-from-romantica/), we discussed the [demise of No Depression's print magazine](http://nodepression.net/blogs/letter). Soon after Kyle Matteson and Steve McPherson attended SXSW. Who should attend [Reveille Magazine](http://reveillemag.com)'s day party but Peter Blackstock, co-editor of No Depression. Peter actually discussed listening to the podcast w/ Kyle. I had to review it to make sure I didn't say anything asinine.

Instance two: I mentioned [drop.io](http://drop.io) the other day here. Who should [comment on the post](http://anthonygthomas.com/2008/04/11/transparency/#comment-6) but [someone directly involved with the company](http://twitter.com/lessin).

Instance three: I made a few off-hand comments at MinneWebCon via [Twitter](http://twitter.com/truetone). Who responded to me directly? One of the organizers of the event.

Instance four: I wrote about APML here earlier this week. Who added the post to [his ma.gnolia links](http://ma.gnolia.com/people/ChrisSaad/bookmarks/vrokiqekut)? [Chris Saad](http://twitter.com/ChrisSaad), one of the founders of [apml.org](http://apml.org).

We're no longer sequestered in our rooms in the cold glow of a CRT. We're talking and exchanging ideas. How you doin?
