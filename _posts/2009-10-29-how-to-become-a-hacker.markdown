[How to Become a Hacker](http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html#why_this).

> Hackers solve problems and build things, and they believe in freedom and voluntary mutual help. To be accepted as a hacker, you have to behave as though you have this kind of attitude yourself. And to behave as though you have the attitude, you have to really believe the attitude.

This reminds me of a high school friend who once told me, "Punk isn't a kind of music, it's an _attitude_." Whatever dude.
