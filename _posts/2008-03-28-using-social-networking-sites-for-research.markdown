Is there anyone out there who is leveraging social networking technology _for_ research? It seems like there's a lot of research out there _on_ it, but who's taking advantage of it? With a little imagination, it doesn't seem hard to find some uses. Let's start with an easy one: [Twitter](http://twitter.com).

[Where I work](http://lamp.med.umn.edu/actu/), we're doing a study where we monitor a group of participants for 4 years. They come to the clinic every 4 weeks to have their blood drawn and fill out a survey. We also monitor their symptoms. [It's a study on mononucleosis](http://www.lamp.med.umn.edu/actu/?page_id=86). None of these participants have been exposed yet. We're waiting to see when they are exposed. We want to see how sick they get and what the risk factors are.

Now every 2 weeks I send them a reminder to log in to our website and report any symptoms they may be having at the time. (It's a simple little homebrewed application I developed. Thank you very much.) The process is fairly painless and once you've done it once, you can generally complete it in under a minute.

What if we used Twitter (or a Twitter-like tool) to do the same thing? Study participants follow a department profile. Once every two weeks a tweet goes out that says, "Have a sore throat? Fatigue? Swollen or Tender glands? Reply 'd @[truetone](http://twitter.com/truetone) yes'". We'd reach participants wherever they are instantly. No waiting until they are tethered to a computer.

In this case, the immediacy is not all that necessary. But I'm sure there is research out there where it could be beneficial. Doing marketing research? What better way to instantaneously compile data? What better way to instantaneously disseminate data? See where I'm headed?

There's a lot of talk in marketing about engaging consumers. What if we frame research in marketing terms? I know of at least one department at [The Big U](http://umn.edu) that already does mass mailings. Let's bring that into the 21st century. I'm just saying, with a little imagination, we can take advantage of some really fun, cutting edge technology. It may be more than just novel. It may be important.
