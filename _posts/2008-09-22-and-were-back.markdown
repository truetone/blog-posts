I have been so incredibly busy the last few months that aside for 140 character Twitter updates, I haven't been able to keep this blog updated with my exploits.

If you are still paying attention, [I was complaining about ACL](http://anthonygthomas.com/2008/06/20/wow-acl-is-hard/). After several attempts, I gave up using the [built-in ACL component in CakePHP](http://book.cakephp.org/view/171/Access-Control-Lists) and just decided to keep things simple, [use the Auth component](http://book.cakephp.org/view/172/Authentication) with role-based access control. Problem solved.

The development of the application has progressed smoothly since getting over that hurdle.

In the meantime, I've been setting up my own virtual server for hosting websites for my freelance clients. That has been a learning experience in itself. I'll post more about that as I formally launch that service.

I'm also way behind on podcasts for the Minneapoliscast podcast. I hope to resume that at a modest pace this fall.

More later as all of my respective projects get updates including SVN info on my CakePHP app.
