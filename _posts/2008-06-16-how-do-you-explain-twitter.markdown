I'm connected to a lot of tech-savvy folks (tweeple) via Twitter, but I work and hang out with a lot of not-so-tech-savvy folks (people) in real life. Once in a while the twain will meet, but not often.

My friends who are somewhere in the middle have Twitter accounts, but don't use them like I do. (I.e., they don't tweet via sms, or use it to ask questions of the cloud, etc.) They snicker when they see me tweet in public, but at home and work, they're checking in regularly. I'm don't want to discuss these Twitter-closet folks.

The people I want to discuss are those who don't understand it at all. When I try to explain it to my co-workers, I'm a little timid. Most of the time, I don't even bother even though I've found it very valuable for keeping my finger on the pulse of what's happening in the Twin Cities. I try to explain how I've made friends IRL through Twitter, etc., but their eyes glaze over and I give up.

How do you explain Twitter (and services like it) to those who are unfamiliar or resistant to it?
