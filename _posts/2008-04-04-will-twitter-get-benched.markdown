[The Industry Standard put Twitter on it's "predicted to fail" list](http://www.thestandard.com/news/2008/03/30/twitter-fanatical-users-help-build-brand-not-revenue).


> **Failings:** There's no compelling reason for most people to use it, and many existing services -- ranging from AIM to FriendFeed to social networks -- have overlapping functionality. And how is it supposed to make money?


That's the $10,000 question isn't it? (Pun intended.) Where's the money in it?

When I was a senior in high school (in 1988), a teacher once told me that in the near future information would be the key factor in success and power. It sounded good, but I didn't quite get what he was talking about at the time. Now look at us. Google is the case and point for what he was talking about.

The information contained in Twitter is not as voluminous as what Google has to offer, but it's _immediate_. I know within seconds if someone is tweeting about something I'm tracking on Twitter. _Seconds_. It doesn't take a lot of imagination to figure out a potential use for that information. And the last I checked, Twitter was still the most popular of the micromedia sites out there. I think it could go somewhere. You?
